# user-registration-codeigniter3

This is a simple PHP based User Registration system for CodeIgniter. It has Registration, Email verification, Reset password and Login. It uses PHPMailer for email sending. Bootstrap was used for the design.

The original registration system was based from Michael Soriano (https://github.com/michaelsoriano/user-registration-codeigniter). We just did some few changes in the registration system to fit in our preferences like it uses PHPMailer instead.
